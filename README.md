# Name: to be determined (not chess?)

This game was initially developed for chessboard and with chess figures. It may be endless, but who says that's wrong?


# Rules

There are two modes: *classic* (original game, you are able to play it with your chess set) and *natural* (extends basic game with some more or less realistic features). You should familiarize yourself with classic game first, as there is no distinct rulebook for natural mode because of the fact that almost all game concepts from *classic* mode apply to *natural* as well.

## *Classic* mode rules

The setting is a standard 8x8 chessboard with initial position like this:

There are two Kings, being referenced as "capitals", and a capital of each player is main goal for another. 
Two types of figures you can place to the board:

 1. Pawn
 2. War Figure

You win if one of your "War Figures" (Rook, Bishop, (k)Night) reaches enemy's capital.
